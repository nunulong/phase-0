    <h1>What are the benefits of version control?</h1>
    <h3>11/4/2015</h3>
    <p>
      As developers, it is very common that they modify codes quite often. Using version control is to make things easy for developers to manage codes. Here is some benefits of version control.
</p>
  <h3>Back Up Codes</h3>

  <p>Using version control can store the source codes in the repository locally and remotely for developers to review, modify, and distribute. Without losing the whole effort to start over, version control system allow developers to save the codes in somewhere and look them up whenever and wherever they need to. Additionally, version control system saves different versions of sources code which are for development or production phase.</p>

  <h3>Collaborate With Others</h3>

  <p>Version control system allow people collaborate with one another without limitation of space and time. Let us recall the traditional way of collaboration. People create a shared folder or platform and store all source codes there. They never know exactly who is working on which file or piece of codes. Sometimes, one person gets the permission of some file and other people cannot edit it. They have to make the communication and let the work run smoothly. Whereas, version control system is very flexible to people who work on same projects all together. They make their own branches to the master codes and merge thoroughly.</p>

  <h3>Avoid Mistakes</h3>

  <p>Storing different versions of source codes, version control system allow developers to restore the previous codes they would like to use. Also, it is very clear to every individual that who and when makes changes onto codes and how many times somebody modifies codes, all of which allow developers to check out codes they want and roll codes back to a certain check point.</p>

  <h1>
  How does git help you keep track of changes?</h1>

  <p>When using git, you save changes of codes, which is called commit. Committing codes acts as check point of changes. You write down what exactly you do to the code you want to commit. Afterward, you push your code to repository locally and remotely to back up changes. Every time you commit codes, git names a specific header title to identify different versions of codes. You can compare different version of codes via GitHub and see how the code are modified during a period of time. You can type git command "git log" to check out all the changes people made before. You may also restore the previous code you want.</p>

  <h1>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h1>

  <p>
  GitHub is working as a hub of remote repository, which allows developers to collaborate with one another without any limitation. They store their own code locally by using git and upload changes of codes to remote repositories of GitHub as finished version of source codes. Before starting new job, everyone update their local codes from repositories of GitHub to make sure they are on the same page of projects. Each individual makes own branch of master codes to avoid working on finished codes directly. By this way, each individual may work on the copy of finished codes freely and flexibly. After done all the work on the day, members in the team review all of local codes, fix bugs, and make sure codes meet the requirement. The team leader will merge branch code to master code.</p>

<!--
What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
A: I use html, body, h1, h3, p. Because these tags are very common and the backbone of the website.
  
How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
A: The elements get laid out by complying the html semantic tags. The browser displays the elements like a box inside which elements get laid out by the order they are wrapped or nested in other elements.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
A: I learn the snippet shortcut and we can create our own snippet for html model. Yes, I will create more snippets. I learn that the shortcuts of the sublime are very useful and make the coding process a lot easier. Good practice!
thanks
