// Manipulating JavaScript Objects

// I worked on this challenge: [by myself, with: ]

// There is a section below where you will write your code.

// DO NOT ALTER THIS OBJECT BY ADDING ANYTHING WITHIN THE CURLY BRACES!
var terah = {
  name: "Terah",
  age: 32,
  height: 66,
  weight: 130,
  hairColor: "brown",
  eyeColor: "brown"
}
// __________________________________________
// Write your code below.

var adam = {
  name: "Adam",
};
terah["spouse"] = adam;
terah.weight = 125;
delete terah.eyeColor;
adam["spouse"] = terah;
terah.children = {
  carson: {name: "Carson"},
  carter: {name: "Carter"},
  colton: {name: "Colton"},
};
adam.children = terah.children;

// __________________________________________
// Reflection: Use the reflection guidelines

// What tests did you have trouble passing? What did you do to make it pass? Why did that work?

// A: I couldn't pass the test 8 since I created carson object outside the children property so that they were not connected. And I changed the way I create children property. I put carson, carter, and colton objects inside the children property and added name properties to each of these objects. Since the liberal way to create an object is to put the property and value inside while carson, carter, and colton are also objects inside the object, I have to use nested way to create.

// How difficult was it to add and delete properties outside of the object itself?

// A: I think it is easy and clear to add and delete the properties since you just find the property's name and give correct commands to do that.

// What did you learn about manipulating objects in this challenge?

// A: I learn that the JavaScript creates an object just like the hash in Ruby. And I solidify the Ruby hash knowledge.
