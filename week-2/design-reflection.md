2. What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

   Answer:My site's primary goal is to teach people how to read and speak Chinese and to let people know Chinese culture.

   My site will have Chinese lectures and videos for people to learn Chinese, have cultural stories, history, and literature for people to learn Chinese culture, and have challenges and games for people to learn Chinese with big fun.

3. What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

   Answer: My target audience's interests is to find a better way to learn Chinese and they looking forward to authentic Chinese culture. 
   
   My site will provide lots of interesting lectures and videos on how to learn Chinese, lots of historical legends, heroes, myths, and literature on what is authentic Chinese culture. The site will also give many fun games and challenges for people to test how well they master Chinese.

4. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

   Answer: For new members, they need to sign up to the site and start the visual class on-line. Also they will play games using keyboard to test how well they grasp Chinese and collect points for the advanced stuff on the site. 

   For old members, they need to log in the site and customize their own class and portfolios for other members to socialize with. 

   I do wish they may search more information on ShenYun.com which is a very grand website for people to learn Chinese culture and to practice meditation. I am willing to get contact with my audience. 

5. What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

   Answer: Design is about providing solutions to problems, to raise the performance of the site so that users may have good experience surfing on your site. Also, design is to meet users' expectations and demands on what they need. 

   User experience is how a person feels when interfacing with a system. The system could be a website, a web application or desktop software and, in modern contexts, is generally denoted by some form of human-computer interaction. People who work on user experience are looking for ease of use, perception of the value of the system, utility, efficiency in performing tasks and so forth.

6. What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

   Answer: User Experience design is to improve user satisfaction and experience by improving the usability, accessibility, problem-solving provided in the interaction between the user and the product. User experience design is also about humanâ€“computer interaction design. 

   Firstly, UX design improves the satisfaction of users so that users will stick to your site looking for things they want, which let you make a great deal of revenue from your site. Secondly, UX design will let users experience your site from different kind of accessing ways such as mobile, vast landscape of browsers, and diverse Internet connections. UX design may help websites to enhance the pleasant of users.
