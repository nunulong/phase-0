## Reflection Questions

1. What is a wireframe?

   Answer: Wireframe is an important step in any screen design process. It primarily allows you to define the information hierarchy of your design, making it easier for you to plan the layout according to how you want your user to process the information.

   It's like an architectural blueprint; you need to see it in two-dimensional black and white diagrams before you understand how to build the actual house. Similarly for a screen design, you can't start building pixel layers in photoshop, or writing blocks of code, without knowing where the information is going to go.

2. What are the benefits of wireframing?

   Answer: wireframe is very useful in determining how the user interacts with the interface. For example, wireframes can contain various states of button or menu behaviors.

   Wireframing allows the designer to plan the layout and interaction of an interface without being distracted by colors, typeface choices or even copy. 

3. Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

   Answer: Yes. I come up with some ideas of my site and use wireframing technique to blueprint the sketch.

4. Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

   Answer: Yes, I revise my wireframe.

5. What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

   Answer: How do we make a better website? 
   I use Google to search the answer.

6. Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

   Answer: I really enjoy the wireframe part since by this way, I can modify my website layout. 

   I don't have a very clear idea about the wireframe of my website. I need more time to think about what exact website I want to launch.
