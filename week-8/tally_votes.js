// __________________________________________
// Refactored Solution






// __________________________________________
// Reflection

// What did you learn about iterating over nested objects in JavaScript?

// A: I learn that we need to make sure the property is in the object otherwise sometimes we will not operate it. Also we can use for .. in loop syntax to iterate the object which is very more efficient than using for loop.

// Were you able to find useful methods to help you with this?

// A: I use hasOwnProperty to check if the property is in the object so that I can operate the property pretty well.

// What concepts were solidified in the process of working through this challenge?

// A: I think I solidified the JavaScript function and for..in loop and if else work flow.
