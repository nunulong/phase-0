# Release 6: Reflect

   1. What is a one-to-one database?

     Answer: one-to-one means one type of data in the table only is only related to one type of data in another table. It is like the key-value pair.

   2. When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).

     Answer: Generally, I won't use one-to-one database since the data in the second table can be added to the first table since they are unique to each other. We can save many tables when creating the database.
   
   3.What is a many-to-many database?
   
     Answer: Many-to-many means different types of data in the database have many different types of data and also different many types of data belong to one type of data in the database. Also we will put a join table in between to track the keys of both other tables.

   4.When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
   
     Answer: I will use it in some complicated occasion if the data has many other data and many other data will have many kind of this data. 

   5.What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?

     Answer: I think it is very straightforward. It is just like a library with different books and we create the database to serve us with high efficiency.
